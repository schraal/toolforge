Welcome to Karma

****************

This is the second alpha version of Karma, the tool-to-be for software
configuration management.

Sit back and relax, this is NOT Windows, and will not take forever to
install; a mere 15 seconds is all.

For now, we assume you have JDK1.4.2_xx installed and an environment variable
JAVA_HOME set. In later versions, we'll package the JRE as well.

After installation :

- If you have old seet

- Set your KARMA_HOME environment variable to where you installed Karma.

- Add $KARMA_HOME/bin to you PATH and make sure your new PATH settings are
  activated.

- Start Karma (linux/unix : 'karma', Windows : 'karma.bat')

- Following the instructions. You will be walked through a few configuration
  items to enable Karma to find manifests and locations. This is all CVS
  stuff, so you should be able to deduct what is meant here.

This README file is available after installation for further reference.

Enjoy !
