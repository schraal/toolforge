 <section name="What is the Karma Launcher?">

 <p>
	The Karma Launcher is a tool that can launch an application. The classes needed by
	the application are loaded through a KarmaClassLoader called <code>karma.root</code>.
	This ClassLoader is available through the KarmaClassLoaderRepository. The 
	KarmaClassLoaderRepository can contain several classloaders. These classloaders are independent
	of eachother. The Karma Launcher gives an application the opportunity to execute/invoke
	other java applications inside a single virtual machine, without clashes between versions 
	of jars used by these applications. The jars needed by the application are automatically
	downloaded from a remote repository and stored locally.
 </p>

<section name="Karma Launcher Configuration">
 <p>
	The Karma Launcher needs/allows several configuration items.
	<ul>
		<li>
			KarmaClassLoaderRepository configuration
		</li>
		<li>
			The configuration of the remote repositories.
		</li>
		<li>
			The configuration of the local repositories.
		</li> 
	
	</ul>
 </p>
 <subsection name="KarmaClassLoaderRepository configuration.">
	The configuration of the <code>KarmaClassLoaderRepository</code> is done 
	through a file. The name and location of the configuration file is defined 
	through the system property <code>karma.classloaderrepository.config</code>. The
	file is first searched on the filesystem, if it is not found there, it
	is searched on the classpath.
