<p>The <code>core</code> package contains packages and classes related to
the very core of the Karma toolset (you'd never guess that, right ?).

<p>The core of the Karma toolset consists of the architecture to manage
so-called manifests (see the {@link nl.toolforge.karma.core.Manifest}
interface), groups of modules that make up an application or part thereof.

<p>A developer can control a manifest using a set of commands. Each module in
a manifest is - obviously - located in a version control system. Support for
CVS has been implemented, support for Subversion is planned (that's the most
diplomatic answer, isn't it ?).

<h5>Core dependencies</h5>

<p>The <code>core</code> package has a number of dependencies with third party
libraries. The following table shows the list of dependencies and the reason(s) for
this dependency.
