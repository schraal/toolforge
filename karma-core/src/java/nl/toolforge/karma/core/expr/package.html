<p>This package contains classes and interfaces to validate domain entities for
Karma. Domain entities are things like 'module name', 'version number',
'manifest name', etc. These entities' formats must be checked to ensure that
they are compliant with the standards set in a project environment.

<p>In this version (<b>karma-core-2.0</b>), the standards are set by us, but in
later versions, you can expect a fully configurable environment.
