<p>The <code>location</code> package contains classes managing location objects. Each module in a manifest
has a location attached to it. A location could be a CVS repository, but also a Maven repository; it is a
rather abstract definition of a place where a module is located.</p>

<p>Location objects are stored in XML files. The {@link nl.toolforge.karma.core.LocalEnvironment} class defines
the directory on disk where location xml files are stored. Location xml files are generally company-wide and as
such they could very well be managed in a version control system.</p>

<p>The following XML blob shows the structure of such a file:</p>

<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;locations>

  &lt;location type="cvs-repository" id="cvs-local"&gt;
    &lt;protocol&gt;local&lt;/protocol&gt;
    &lt;host&gt;localhost&lt;/host&gt;
    &lt;port&gt;2401&lt;/port&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;/home/cvs&lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;/location>

&lt;/locations>

</pre>

<p>Each location has a <code>type</code>. The domain for the <code>type</code> attribute is defined in the
{@link nl.toolforge.karma.core.location.Location} interface. The <code>id</code> attribute is the unique identifier
for the location. In the manifest definition, a module requires one of these <code>id</code>s.

<p>Depending on the type of location, certain elements are expected. A CVS location, for instance, requires
a <code>protocol</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>port</code> and <code>repository</code>.

<p>Next to the location definition, certain types of locations require authentication data as well. Since these
location definitions can be maintained in a version control repository, authentication data is stored separately.
Karma knows which types of locations require authentication data and will try and read this from the configuration
directory (<code>$HOME/.karma</code>). Files following the <code>repository-authenticator*</code>-pattern are scanned
for entries that match the location.

<p>The following XML blob shows the structure of such an authenticator file:</p>

<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;authenticators>
  &lt;authenticator id="cvs-local" username="asmedes" password="bogus"&gt;
  &lt;authenticator id="sf-toolforge" username="asmedes"&gt;
&lt;/authenticators>

</pre>

<p>The snippet above has a matching <code>id</code>-attribute for the <code>cvs-local</code> location and will be used
as input for the corresponding location object.

<p>Some bits are not yet implemented in this release. The second &lt;authenticatorgt&; element instance shows a
situation, whereby only a username is configured. This would apply to configurations where a public SSH key is stored
on the (remote) server, so no password should be given upon each request. Will be implemented later.
