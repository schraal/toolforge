 <section name="What is Toolforge?">

 <p>
    Toolforge is the Sourceforge project name for a suite of tools related
    to release and configuration management. The suite is also known as <b>Karma</b>
    which is derived from <b>C</b>ode <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>elease <b>M</b>anagement
	  <b>A</b>pplication, but 'CARMA' wasn't good enough a name for us.
 </p>

 <p>
    Using a version control system to manage source code repositories and
    build tools like <emp>Ant</emp> and <emp>Maven</emp> alone is not enough
    for software development centers where component management and reuse of
    software is an hot issue.
