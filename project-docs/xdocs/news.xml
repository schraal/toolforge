    We are currently working on <b>Karma R1.0</b>. A lot of glitches have to
    be fixed, but we are getting there. Stay tuned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current - most stable - release is <code>karma-1-0-beta6</code>. This
    release is currently being tested heavily by a number of developers on
    different platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our <strong>first real-life implementation</strong> is underway. A major software product
    company in The Netherlands is well underway to be the first in the world
    to implement Karma. The toolset is implemented for a mere 50 developers,
    release coordinators and maintenance personnel. We will ask them to post a
    testimony on this website the moment they've gone life.

    Silently our one year anniversary on SF.net has gone by. Activity has been
    minimal lately. However, development has been picked up today (18 Jan
    2005) and R1.0 will be out soon. Strategy meetings are being planned,
    conference talks will be pursued and our first implementation is going to
    happen this year. So, keep watching this place!
