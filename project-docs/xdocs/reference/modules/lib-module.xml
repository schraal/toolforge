    <section name="Library modules">
      <p>
        A module of this type stores libraries (typically 3rd party libraries).
        These libraries are used as dependencies of a module. How to do this is
        described in <a href='module-dependencies.html'>module dependencies</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a library module is nothing more than a container for <code>.jar</code>
        files, building or packaging a library module has no effect.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Layout">
      <p>
        The following layout is defined for a library module. All other files and/or
        directories are ignored.
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Source</th>
            <th>Build</th>
            <th>Package</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>/lib</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>This directory contains the <code>.jar</code> files to which other
              modules can have a dependency. Building, testing or packaging has no
              effect on the contents of this directory.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
