    <section name="Module states">
      <p>
        A module can have three states:
        <ul>
          <li>Static: the module's version and development line are fixed.</li>
          <li>Dynamic: the module's version is not fixed, the development line is (either main-line
            or a development line). The module is kept up to date with the development line's latest tagged version.</li>
          <li>Working: the module's version is not fixed. The module is kept up-to-date with the development-line's head.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, a module is defined in the manifest either as Static or Dynamic. After an update
        of the manifest, static modules are checked out with the version as specified in the manifest. Dynamic modules
        are checked out with the latest available version.
      </p>

    <section name="State changes">
      <p>
        As static specifies, the version of a static module can't change. And therefor its state can't change.

      <p>
        A dynamic module
        changes version automatically when a new version becomes available. Besides that its state can change to working. This
        means that the developer is working on the module, i.e. making changes to the contents of the module.
        When the developer is finished developing the state of the module can be changed back to dynamic. However at this
        moment the changes that were made are not visible to the rest of the developers. To do this the developer has to promote
        the module *before* changing the state to dynamic. A promote basically increases the version number of a module.
