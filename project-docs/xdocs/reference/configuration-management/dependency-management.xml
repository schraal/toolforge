  <section name="Determining dependencies between modules">

  <p>
    In order to build a manifest, i.e. to build all its modules, the manifest
    needs to determine dependencies with other modules defined in the manifest
    as well as dependencies with (third-party) libraries. A good example of how
    such a mechanism would work is <a
    href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>. A single Maven-enabled project
    contains a <code>project.xml</code> file in which binary dependencies are
    defined. Maven reactor adds one extra methodology, where multiple modules
    (projects in Maven terminology) are managed using a the
    <code>reactor</code> tool.

    Here's the Karma logic:

  <ul>
    <li/>A <code>SourceModule</code>
  </ul>
