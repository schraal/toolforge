    Without an exception : if one knows Maven, that one will ask us the
    question : "Why don't you use Maven for this ?". Well, the basic answer is
    simple : "The purpose of Karma is different."
  </p>

  <p>
    The following list describes the main differences between the two. We're
    not trying to prove that Karma is better here. We're just pointing out the
    differences for you so you make your own choice. We value your comments.
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>In essence, Maven is a build tool, whereas <strong>Karma</strong>
    focusses on <emp>managing</emp> software components.</li>

    <li>Maven's dependency management is based on binary dependencies. Karma
    works primarily with source dependencies so a developer always has the
    sources available. </li>

    <li>Karma is multi-project, multi-module, etc, whereas Maven supports it
    with Maven reactor.</li>

    <li>Ah, and we don't have memory leaks ... (just kidding here).</li>

  </ol>

  <p>
    There's a lot more to be said about this. Coming soon.

  <section name="Integrate with them ?">

  <p>
    Ok, since we convinced you that <strong>Karma</strong> is indeed different
    from Maven and Ant, one could ask the question : "Why don't you integrate
    with them?". In fact, that's what <strong>Karma</strong> does. Without a
    doubt, Ant and Maven are great in what they do, and we don't intend to
    beat them in that. <strong>Karma</strong> uses Ant a great deal in the
    build and package proces. We've tried to integrate with Maven, but the
    integration level is - in our opinion - a bit meagre. We've been told that
    integration on the Java level will improve from Maven 2.0 onwards, so who
    knows what will happen in the near future with Karma, but for now, we
    stick to Ant.
