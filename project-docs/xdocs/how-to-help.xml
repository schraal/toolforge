    We are always open for critical notes, but they have to be founded. We
    will seriously consider implemented good ideas in new versions of Karma
    (or related tools under the Toolforge project).

    Please share your views on the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=98766">public forums</a> on
    Sourceforge.

    The tools we build under the Toolforge project at Sourceforge are open
    source and totally free to use. However, to be able to spread our vision
    and build even better tools, we need your support. You can help by
    donating to the Toolforge Foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are currently in the process of setting up the Toolforge
    Foundation. Please keep an eye on this page. We will keep you posted.
