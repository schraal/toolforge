  <section name="Feature List">

  <p>
    The following listing shows most, if not all, of Karma's features. For
    clarity, they've been structured in a number of categories.
  </p>

  <subsection name="Building and Packaging">

  <p>
    Although not Karma's unique selling point, we have implemented a
    sophisticated build and package system, fully tailored to the way Karma
    manages software modules.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>Java code is built and packaged on a per module basis, inherently
    ensuring that no circular dependencies can exist between two or more
    modules.</li>

    <li>Source code compilation with <code>javac</code> and <code>jikes</code>.</li>

  </ul>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Structural Features">

  <p>
    Karma helps in structuring source code, modularization and
    componentization.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Four main types of modules, each with a standardized directory
    structure.</li>

    <li>Working contexts allow for and organized structure of software
    projects, one for each client ... or project. The amount of working
    contexts is unlimited.</li>

  </ul>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="User Interface Features">

  <p>
    There is fancy no graphical user interface, but the command-line and the
    console will do just fine.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Help system; each command is well-documented.</li>

    <li>Commands can have any number of aliasses; users can implement their
        own favourites.</li>
  </ul>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Developer Features">

  <ul>

    <li>Clearly documented Java API allowing developers to extend the
    system.</li>

    <li>It is easy to create plugins to extend Karma with your own
    commands.</li>

  </ul>
